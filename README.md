###Part 2
####I choose to using Time-Based to change the code
####In my project, the dots around the circles will clockwise rotate ,the conterclockwise around the center after the set time. My groupmates projects are changing colors by mouse clicking and the dots will shaking by Perlin noise.
####My individual project's inspiration is the YouTube creator Bedrettin Şimşek's video The animation of VAN GOGH's starry night. The lines moivng in different directions to animating the art work. This project inspired me that the moving images make the original works more alive and attractive.
